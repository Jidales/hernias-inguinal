    <h2>A Message From Dr. Daniel</h2>
    <p>"I've repaired over 1,000 pediatric hernias in my career — and each one matters deeply. Parents often come to me feeling anxious and uncertain. My goal is not just to fix the hernia, but to guide families with clarity, safety, and empathy. In private practice, you’re not just another case — you’re my priority."</p>
  </section>

  <section id="what-is-hernia">
    <h2>What Every Parent Should Know About Hernias</h2>
    <p>An inguinal hernia appears as a bulge in your child’s groin. It happens when a part of the intestine or ovary (in girls) slips through a weak spot in the abdominal wall. It may look small, but it can become dangerous quickly.</p>
    <p>If left untreated, it can lead to sudden pain, vomiting, or tissue damage (strangulation). Surgery is the only permanent solution — and today, it's safer than ever.</p>

  <section id="why-surgery" style="background:#f4f4f4;">
    <h2>Why Choose Keyhole (Laparoscopic) Surgery?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Smaller, almost invisible scars</li>
      <li>Less pain for your child</li>
      <li>Faster recovery (often home the same day)</li>
      <li>We can check & repair both sides in one go</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="what-to-expect">
    <h2>What Happens During Surgery?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Short consultation to confirm the diagnosis</li>
      <li>30-minute keyhole surgery</li>
      <li>Back home same day</li>
      <li>Most children return to normal play in 2–3 days</li>
    </ol>
